# RPS-with-JS

This is my first rock paper scissors game tghat I made using JS
The way to play this is that user will put their choices of either rock paper or scissors by putting R for rock, P for paper and S for scissors.

Computer will then randomly choice either rock paper scissors as well, the rest is the same with the original rule of rock, paper, scissors.

There will be a scoreboard to keep tracks of wins, losses, and, ties.

Enjoy!
